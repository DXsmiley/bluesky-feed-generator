        <p>Top posts made in the last 48 hours by all furry women, replies not included.</p>
        <p>I created this because I noticed other furry feeds (both chronological and algorithmic) on bluesky were overwhelmingly dominated by men.</p>
        <h2>Who Is Included On The Feed?</h2>
        <p>Currently, "furries" constitutes anybody who follows one of a short list of major furry accounts. It does not dynamically update, and ends up including some people who are not furries. This is a temporary solution before something better is built.</p>
        <p>The algorithm defines "woman" as anyone with whose bio contains fem-aligned pronouns (she/her, she/they, ...), a female (‚ôÄÔ∏è) or sapphic (‚ö¢) emoji, or an age-gender indicator (e.g. 25F). Presently, those who mix fem and masc pronouns (e.g. she/they/he) are excluded.</p>
        <h2>How is the feed ranked?</h2>
        <p>Each post is scored individually, depending on its age, and the amount of <i>positive-sentiment</i> interaction its getting</p>

        <p>Remember that posts older than 48 hours will not show up on the feed</p>
